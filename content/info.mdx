## Vision

Multiverse is a place for cool people to do cool things - people from all different backgrounds, ages and walks of life will come together to create a positive collective experience. Our vision is to involve more and more people in this movement, building new connections, sharing ideas and wisdom, displaying creative endeavors and providing social enrichment. We encourage you to think about how you can improve the festival experience for yourselves and others.

## Location

After 3 years, Multiverse has outgrown its original home in the plantation forest, but will still be based at the southern end of Tasmania. We are excited to move to a new home, but we can’t give the location out just yet. Stay tuned for more information closer to the event.

## Camping

Please stick to the designated camping area. You can bring your own food and non-alcoholic drinks, but only for personal use, not for sale. Gas Cookers are permitted for outdoor use. Do not use gas cookers in your tent! If fire safety conditions change and this policy changes, you will be informed upon entry to the festival. There should be ample space for all attendees, but please do not use more than you require.

## Conditions Of Entry

This is an outdoor festival in a natural environment. There are certain risks associated with these activities and by attending you agree to accept full responsibility for yourself and your actions. Management reserves the right to refuse entry & unsociable behaviour will not be tolerated. All cars entering the property may be subject to inspection for compliance with our event policies. This is a condition of entry to the event. The Festival rules listed above are also conditions of entry and failure to observe these rules may result in eviction from the festival.

## Road Safety

Please drive safely and responsibly to the festival. Road safety is a big priority so make sure you are well rested and drive safely. Please pay attention to the following guidelines
Make sure you have slept enough before doing the drive.
Do not drive under the influence of alcohol or any other substances
Expect RBT's and/or Drug Swab Testing going into and out of the festival. The local police have staged these in previous years and we expect this to happen again. This is in the interests of public road safety for both the event and the local community and we can't stress enough how important it is to make sure you are well rested and sober before driving to/from the festival.
A drink and drug testing service will be available from Blow Me First at all times near the main First Aid tent, and at the festival exit on Monday and Tuesday. If you are in doubt, please utilise this service and save yourself the risk.

## Sneak-ins policy

Unfortunately there are some people who choose to sneak in to the festival to avoid paying or contributing. This is unfair to everyone and damages the festival. For those who have a genuine problem with affording an entry ticket we encourage you to pursue volunteer work opportunities, or consider our cheaper tickets early in the year. To discourage this behaviour further, not only will the person found be refused entry – but all the passengers in the car will be banned as well for being accessories and no ticket refunds will be issued. Don't do it!

## Festival Times

The festival runs from midday Friday May 12th to 6pm Monday May 15th. Public arrival time is Friday May 12th 9am onwards. If you would like to arrive earlier, look out for our camping upgrade options which provide early entry. The site clear out deadline is midday Tuesday 16th May. Please ensure you are well rested and sober and able to leave the venue safely by this time.
