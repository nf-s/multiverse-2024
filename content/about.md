_A ripple in the space-time continuum has torn a rift in our Universe, opening up to the Multiverse beyond. This presents a unique opportunity for expanded consciousness, to see the world from another perspective. This January, we invite you to transcend beyond the physical Universe, and experience the Multiverse._

Multiverse Festival is a unique open air music, arts and lifestyle festival promoting self-expression and freedom in natural landscapes. As we look forward to our fourth edition, we remain fiercely independent - we are proudly free of corporate sponsorship, state-funding or political affiliations.
