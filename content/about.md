A ripple in the space-time continuum has torn a rift in our Universe, opening up to the Multiverse beyond. This presents a unique opportunity for expanded consciousness, to see the world from another perspective. This January, we invite you to transcend beyond the physical Universe, and experience the Multiverse.

Multiverse is a multi-day, multi-genre outdoor dance party taking place in the southern forests of Tasmania. The goal of the party is to create a space for cool people to do cool things, if you have an idea for the event let us know and we will try to facilitate it.
This year we will be offering an early ticket for those wishing to attend on the Thursday (for the public holiday), with early camping and some entertainment, with the main musical programme starting Friday 27th.

Technobrats are committed to delivering cutting-edge parties, with high quality production values.
