After 3 iterations, Multiverse has outgrown its original home in the southern pine forests, and will move to the beautiful site of Redbanks. Located in Nugent, less than one hour from Hobart, this idyllic spot enjoys the shade of beautiful eucalypts, and features sprawling fields for camping (with a creek adjoining the campsite).

Some of you may already be familiar with the site, as Redbanks was recently the site for the Great Escape Festival over NYE, and there have been several events here in the past. The site is easy to find, using either [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/78RhwLM2BN5VEUGD9) (or just following the road signs), and the road in is excellent, suitable for all types of vehicles.

We are excited at the opportunities this site presents, and we can't wait to show you what we have planned. So join us at Redbanks from 25 January as we transcend beyond the physical Universe, and experience the Multiverse.

## Location

Multiverse is located at Redbanks in Nugent, near Sorell. The address of the property is 276 Masons Rd Nugent, and you can find it on [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/78RhwLM2BN5VEUGD9).

The road is well maintained, and suitable for all types of vehicles. Please drive carefully to the site, and obey all speed limits. Once at Redbanks, follow the signs and drive slowly to the Multiverse site. Have your ticket and ID ready so you can receive your wristband.
