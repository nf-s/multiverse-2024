Music is at the core of the Multiverse experience! We pride ourselves on careful curation, as we cover a wide range of genres and styles that will satisfy all tastes.

The Main Stage is the beating heart of Multiverse, and is the place to be if you are feeling like a good dance. We move from Techno, Bass, Psy-Trance, to House, with over 72 hours of non-stop music. And the Chill Space is the place to be if you are feeling like a change of pace, with downtempo, chillout and lounge for days.
